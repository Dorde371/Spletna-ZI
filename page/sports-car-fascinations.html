                        <p>You have to fight for a big dream. And a bold vision. The next victory? Rarely will it simply fall into your lap. Often though, there are three main factors you must fight against: resistance, conventions, and rigid patterns of thinking.</p>
                        <p>Whatever your dream is, nothing is achieved without passion, grit, and determination. Dr. Ferry Porsche gave his all to create the sports car of his dreams. His dream came true. Not because he hesitated, dwelled, or got lucky, but because he was the extra mile.</p>
                        <p>This attitude is in every Porsche we've created since 1948. It's there in the smallest part and in every race we've won. Because we fight. We fight for one more crucial percentage point. For the one second that means the difference between triumph and defeat. For the "Dr. Ing." in our company name and for the chance to set passion for the sports car, time and time again.</p>

                        <p>To us, it's never been about extra horsepower alone. It's about engines that are more efficient, not bigger. It's about a design that follows principles, not trends. It's about sports cars that can be driven day in and day out.</p>
                        <p>It's only when all those things come together that we can talk of Intelligent Performance—the core of the Porsche brand and its future. That is what we fight for. Just as we did on day one. We are fighting for a dream that will forever be in our hearts.</p>
