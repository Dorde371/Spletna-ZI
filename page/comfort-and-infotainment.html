                        Only a single line is required to describe the 911 design, which has remained unique for decades. That iconic shape is reflected in what is arguably our greatest innovation: the retractable roof system. The 911 Cabriolet's roof is a technical masterpiece, and its contemporary counterpart in the current 911 is no exception.<br><br>
                        To appreciate the design of the 911, it's best to experience the design of the 911 Cabriolet. Its roof is lightweight and can be opened and closed at speeds of up to 31 mph. The permanently tensioned rear window and the panel bow-shaped magnesium elements make the roof highly robust and weatherproof, even at high speeds. For a feeling of open-top driving, the roof can be partially opened and closed, keeping the cabin as quiet as possible.<br><br>
                        The 911 Cabriolet models also feature an electrically powered wind deflector, offering even greater enjoyment when driving with the top down and minimal wind noise.
